Dagger2:

- Dagger2 is not a DI it's only an annotation processor (just a code generatorand also butterknife is a code generator) so Dagger2 is a code generator that allow for a well written code with DI in mind to use the DI without letting you write a lot of boilerplate code.

- It's not a bad practice to draw up the dependancy graph on a white paper before implement it for example:
Example1:
Activity
- GithubService                  - Picassa
 - Retrofit                       -OkHttp3Downloader
  - Gson   - OKHttp                  -OkHttp
   -Logger                - Cache
                           -File
Example2:
- Fragment
 - Presenter
  - Interactor
   - DataCalls -Interceptor

Example3:
- Fragment
 - Presenter
  - Interactor
   - UserInfoDataRepository
    - userInfoDataStoreFactory    - userInfoMapper
     - userInfoCache -Retrofit

- Videos then SO Questions

------------------
It seems like we build a diffrent independent components
1 for Application contains all the app needed instances
1 for fragments contains all the fragment needed instances
1 for activity contains all the activity needed instances
